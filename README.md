This somewhat works, I got it to work then, without changing anything, tried again and then it didnt work.

possible reasons: amazon rate limiting me, javascript is dynamically changing div tags

anyways attached is the dataset that was produced when it ran properly.
also the 'print("fuck)' was there when it worked and im scared to remove it.
(ik it doesnt do anything, but the one time i added it, it worked :D )

to install it
run: 'python3 -m pip install -r rec.txt' in the directory.

then to run it:
'python3 main.py'

its really weird
