"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
"I love the 2nd generation Airpods, more than the most recent models, this is basically due to the comfort they offer, they are really comfortable when placed in the ears.What do I like about these airpods?:- The physical ergonomics of the product are very comfortable in the ear, it does not fall out or hurt as the hours go by.- The connectivity between the airpod and the iPhone is almost perfect, it almost always works very well and pairs well, although there are times when only one earbud can be heard but it is solved by putting them back in their case, sometimes it can be a little annoying but it is done. I hold on.- The audio quality is very good, it sounds really good.- The quality of the microphone when I am on calls with other people is very good, the person I am talking to always hears me very well and without interference or strange sounds.- You can buy the case you want to protect them.- Quick compatibility with the iPad.- Obviously it does not have noise cancellation, but for that I have another full headset product, I use these airpods while I pay attention to what is happening in the environment, I would not like to be isolated, and above all it sounds good and for calls it is excellent."
"The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a popular choice for wireless earbuds, and they come with a Lightning charging case that offers a convenient way to charge and store them. Here's a detailed review based on my experience:Sound Quality (4/5):The sound quality of these earbuds is generally good. They deliver clear and well-balanced audio, making them suitable for a wide range of music genres and audio content. However, some audiophiles may find that they lack the depth and richness found in higher-end headphones.Wireless Connectivity (5/5):Apple has always excelled in creating seamless wireless connections, and the AirPods are no exception. The pairing process is incredibly easy, and they seamlessly connect to your Apple devices via Bluetooth. The connection remains stable, and you can switch between devices effortlessly.Comfort and Fit (4/5):The AirPods are designed to be comfortable for extended use. They're lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. However, some users might find them a bit loose during intense physical activities or while running.Battery Life (4/5):The included Lightning charging case offers an additional 24 hours of battery life, making it easy to keep the earbuds powered up throughout the day. While this is a decent battery life, there are other models on the market that offer even longer playtime.Charging (4/5):The Lightning connector is both a pro and a con. It's convenient if you already own Apple devices, but it's limiting if you use other devices with different charging ports. It would be great to have USB-C compatibility for broader appeal.Voice Assistant Integration (5/5):The AirPods have excellent voice assistant integration with Siri, making it effortless to control your music, check the weather, or send messages with just your voice.Price (3/5):The AirPods are on the higher end of the price range for wireless earbuds. While they offer a great experience, some users might find more affordable options with similar features from other brands.Overall (4/5):The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a solid choice for those in the Apple ecosystem who want reliable wireless earbuds with seamless connectivity and good sound quality. They are comfortable for daily use and come with a convenient charging case. However, the price may deter budget-conscious shoppers, and the Lightning connector might be inconvenient for non-Apple users. If you're willing to invest in quality wireless earbuds and enjoy the Apple ecosystem, these are a great pick."

"I love Apple products.  Why?  Because they are simple and work great. I've used generic earbuds before and they use to annoy the hell out of me.  No matter how many earpieces I use, they always manage to pop out of my ears at the worst possible time.  Try finding your earbud that fell on to the floor of a packed subway car.  Not fun.  I have the generation 2 as well as the generation 2 pro.  Generation 2 Pro wins hands down but it is pricey.  For the average user, who doesn't need all the bells and whistles, gen 2 is just fine.  But, be warn, there are limited functions by touch.  There is stop/play/forward/rewind.  The noise cancellation is above average.  The sound quality is also above average.  When using it on calls, the sound is clear and crisp.  If you have an iPhone, it pairs automatically.  On rare occasions, the airpods become disconnected and I have to manually pair them again.  I don't know why this happens.  But, it is something you should be aware of.  Overall, I think it is an above average wireless airpods."
"If you have an apple phone, you should definitely get these. Don't opt for the ""cheaper brands of airpods"". It's worth every penny. I know as I got a few cheaper brands and they only lasted a few months, were too bulky and didn't fit right in my ears and took forever to connect. Glad I bought these and will only purchase Apple airpods moving forward."

"Let's first start off with noise cancellation: It's non-existent. You WILL hear everything going on around you, with turning the volume up just damaging your ears. This is due to the AirPod kind of laying inside your ear, which doesn't create a seal as in earbuds with silicone tips. This not only kills any noise cancellation, but will cause sound to bleed to the outside when loud enough (say around 50%).The issues above are also benefits in environments like offices or schools. This is thanks to the lack of noise cancellation. With music playing, talking to someone sounds just the same as without them. In addition, without a seal being created in your ear, they have to be louder than usual, which they certainly are (Not by a huge margin, but a noticeable one). Now for the stem of the AirPods, they aren't just for show. The microphones in the stem help make calls sound clear and usable.The shape of the AirPods are a hit-or-miss. They'll either fit you or they won't. The best way you could test this is by trying on some EarPods, as they are pretty much AirPods with wires (design-wise). For me, they fit my ears, but start to slip off on their own. They don't fall, but they give me the sensation that they will. You can fix this with some rubber hooks that go on the AirPods to hold them in place inside your ears (You'll need to remove them when putting them back in their case though).The battery life is...fine. It's not abysmal and will last you a good while, but it's not anything to write home about. At least the pop-up when opening the case will remind you of charging them (On an iPhone, I don't think it'll do this on Android). It charges via lightning, but there is a version available with a wireless charging case if you'd like.Sound quality is good, but not perfect. Bass is not it's strong point, and some instruments do get muffled out on some tracks. Vocals can be heard well (which helps out on calls) though. Disclaimer: I'm not an audiophile, just a guy that listens to music for hours.Initial pairing is relatively simple on an iPhone/Mac, just open them while being close to your intended device. The AirPods connect nearly instant when taking them out of the case. While I can't speak for Android or Windows devices, I would assume that they would pair the same way as any other devices, but don't take my word for it.Also, there is no official water/sweat resistance to them. I haven't used them in these environments, but have heard stories of them surviving washing machines (Which I will not be testing). Take that with a grain of salt though.Overall, they are great earphones for me, but make sure you know what you need of your earphones first. If you make a lot of calls and want to hear everything around you, these are the ones to go for."
Can’t believe it took me this long to try Air Pods. They sound EXCELLENT. Easy to use. Super comfy. My only qualm is the lid of the case feels like it will 100% break one day if it catches anything in motion so just be careful. Really do love these headphones though.
"It’s Apple.  While there will always be something better out there, these head phones fit snug and sound rather well.  The quality is well built and holds up to the Apple standards and it syncs effortless with your phone."
